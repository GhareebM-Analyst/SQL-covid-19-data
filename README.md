# SQL covid-19 project
This repository contains the [Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/SQL-covid-19-data/blob/main/covid_19_dataset%20cleaning.ipynb) used to clean and manipulate a dataset downloaded from 'Our World in Data'website using this [link](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv). Subsets of data were generated and used to construct a [SQL database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GhareebM-Analyst/SQL-covid-19-data/main/covid_19_database.sql) which then utilized to create [dataset](https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/SQL-covid-19-data/blob/main/data_world.csv) of monthly aggregated dataset of cases that eventually was used to create visualization in Tableau Software. The code used to generate the summary table can be see [here](https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/SQL-covid-19-data/blob/main/Data_Summary.sql)
